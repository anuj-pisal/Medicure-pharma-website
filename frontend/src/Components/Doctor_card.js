          One of the most popular services Medicure offers is diagnostic
          testing. People need to book pathological tests for many reasons.
          But before booking, they wonder if the diagnostic centre can be
          trusted to produce accurate results and how long they might have to
          wait in a queue to get tested. To bypass these hassles, MediCure has
          set up an extensive network of reputed pathological laboratories in
          India. One such lab is Thyrocare. With Thyrocare on board, we can
          give you access to a wide network of diagnostic laboratories.We also
          offer a home collection of samples as well. Bid adieu to anxious
          days of wondering where to book diagnostic tests and embrace the
          MediCure way. <br />
          <br />
          To ease your anxieties, <b>MediCure</b> offers the facility of
          doorstep collection. The technician will come to your house to
          collect samples. And all safety precautions are maintained. A fresh
          collection kit and/or needle will be used so that there is no
          contamination of samples of the spread of diseases. We use special
          ice boxes that meet NABL guidelines to transport your samples. The
          reports will be sent to you online. That means you wonâ€™t have to
          travel to the diagnostic lab to collect your reports.
